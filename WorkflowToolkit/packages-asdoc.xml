                    The Workflow toolkit provides an API for declarative style tasks management. 
                    If you're familiar with Cairngorm 3, the basic concept is similar to the Task 
                    library (http://sourceforge.net/adobe/cairngorm/wiki/CairngormLibraries/#Task) 
                    although the Workflow toolkit is a far more advanced framework with data 
                    management features and greater flow control capabilities.<br/><br/>
					Extensions are provided to support Spicelib Parsley, 
					ASToolkit XmlMapping and Adobe AIR specific tasks.
